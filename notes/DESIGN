attach
	stat remote root directory, fail if it doesn't exist.
open
	nothing special, perhaps fail if directory is being opened for writing...  ORCLOSE is bad, error out for it.  OTRUNC is handled by an empty put first.
create
	if file, put empty file
	if directory, mkcol
write
	dir: error
	file: put with Content-Range and data
read
	dir: propfind, depth: 1, props: creationdate,getcontentlenght,getlastmodified,resourcetype.  will keep readdir results in memory for next reads.
	file: get with Range
stat
	propfind, depth: 0, props same as readdir
wstat
	not allowed, perhpas allow wstat length
walk
	".." cut off path elem and stat it.
	stat (propfind) the path to check it is there.
remove
	delete
clunk
	nothing

url <-> qid (remove qid on create or remove and assign new qid.  for op on absent qid return Estale or something)

hope to ignore multiline reponses, and as much xml as possible.  will not be possible for readdir.

properties -> stat info (PROPFIND, depth 0)
collections -> readdir, walk (PROPFIND, depth 1)
locking -> ignore?  or exclusive use
namespace ops (copy/move) -> wstat of name, ignore others
