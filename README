works.  to use with https urls, specify -c.


# intro

this is webdavfs, a styx/9p2000 file server that accesses files
over http/webdav.  start it like so:

	mount {webdavfs http://yourhost/rootpath/} /n/dav


# install

make sure the package "http" (http library) is installed, see
http://www.ueber.net/code/r/http.

make sure $ROOT is set.  now run "mk" to compile and "mk install"
to install the files.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.

# testing:

- test new http lib


# todo:

- see if some stats can be avoided, lots of them are being done.
  first try to get rid of the navigator.
- somehow fix the inferno ssl3 module, it currently reads until
  either all requested bytes are found or until eof, for keep-alive
  connections, this doesn't work.


# perhaps:

- keep track of version number of file?  it would not detect remote
  writes anyway
- do http digest auth
