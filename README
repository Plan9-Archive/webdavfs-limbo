this is webdavfs, a styx/9p2000 file server that accesses files
over http/webdav.  start it like so:

	mount {webdavfs http://yourhost/rootpath/} /n/dav

to install:
first, get the http library webdavfs is using:

	hg clone static-http://www.ueber.net/who/mjl/hg/http/

and install it (see it's README).

now make a "mkconfig" in the directory this README file is in
(symlink/bind the one from your inferno install), and "mk install".

get:
this code is being kept up to date using mercurial (hg).  to get a
fresh copy:

	hg clone static-http://www.ueber.net/who/mjl/hg/webdavfs/

i'll also keep a regularly updated copy on sources, in contrib/mjl/.

licence:
this code is in the public domain, written by mechiel lukkien, august 2007.


testing:
- test new http lib

todo:
- see if some stats can be avoided, lots of them are being done.
- somehow fix the inferno ssl3 module, it currently reads until either all requested bytes are found or until eof, for keep-alive connections, this doesn't work.

perhaps:
- keep track of version number of file?  it would not detect remote writes anyway
- do http digest auth
